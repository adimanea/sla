Howdy! How can I be of service?
Here's what I know so far:
group
limit
sum
product
integral
derivative
differential
exponential
logarithm
fraction
calculus
analysis
I can help you { study, learn, practice, read, exercise, define } some of these.
You can always end the conversation saying goodbye.
--> I want to read about limits.
I'm not sure I know what you mean. Could you retry?
Adding 'bye' to your reply exits the conversation.
What else do you want to talk about?
Saying goodbye closes the conversation.
--> define group
I can give you the definition of group.
I know 2 definitions of group.
Here is one of them:
> Definition: any number of entities (members) considered as a unit
Is this what you were after?
--> no
Here is another one:
> Definition: a set that is closed, associative, has an identity element and every element has an inverse
Is this what you were after?
--> yes
More topics in your mind?
Write 'bye' whenever you want to exit.
--> practice exponential
When in doubt, practice!
You can always start with the exercises in the textbook.
You should start by reading from the course textbook.
Is there any other subject you would like to talk about?
Writing 'bye' closes the program.
