Stanford dependencies provides a representation of grammatical relations between words in a sentence. They have been designed to be easily understood and effectively used by people who want to extract textual relations. We are now primarily working on an improved taxonomy to capture grammatical relations across languages, including morphologically rich ones. It explains the differences between the five types of representation available, and how such types of representation can be obtained. The definition of the set of dependencies has evolved a little over the years, and the particular patterns used to convert phrase structure trees to dependencies have been improved quite a bit.
